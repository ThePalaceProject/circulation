        arguments will match everything in the search index that
        matches the universal filters (e.g. works must be
        presentation-ready).

        :param collections: Find only works that are licensed to one of
        these Collections.

        :param media: Find only works in this list of media (use the
        constants from Edition such as Edition.BOOK_MEDIUM).

        :param languages: Find only works in these languages (use
        ISO-639-2 alpha-3 codes).

        :param fiction: Find only works with this fiction status.

        :param audiences: Find only works with a target audience in this list.

        :param target_age: Find only works with a target age in this
        range. (Use a 2-tuple, or a number to represent a specific
        age.)

        :param genre_restriction_sets: A sequence of lists of Genre
        objects or IDs. Each list represents an independent
        restriction. For each restriction, a work only matches if it's
        in one of the appropriate Genres.

        :param customlist_restriction_sets: A sequence of lists of
        CustomList objects or IDs. Each list represents an independent
        restriction. For each restriction, a work only matches if it's
        in one of the appropriate CustomLists.

        :param facets: A faceting object that can put further restrictions
        on the match.

        :param script_fields: A list of registered script fields to
        run on the search results.

        to avoid cluttering the method signature:)

        :param excluded_audiobook_data_sources: A list of DataSources that
        provide audiobooks known to be unsupported on this system.
        Such audiobooks will always be excluded from results.

        :param identifiers: A list of Identifier or IdentifierData
        objects. Only books associated with one of these identifiers
        will be matched.

        :param allow_holds: If this is False, books with no available
        copies will be excluded from results.

        :param series: If this is set to a string, only books in a matching
        series will be included. If set to True, books that belong to _any_
        series will be included.

        :param author: If this is set to a Contributor or
        ContributorData, then only books where this person had an
        authorship role will be included.

        :param license_datasource: If this is set to a DataSource,
        only books with LicensePools from that DataSource will be
        included.

        :param updated_after: If this is set to a datetime, only books
        whose Work records (~bibliographic metadata) have been updated since
        that time will be included in results.

        :param match_nothing: If this is set to True, the search will
        not even be performed -- we know for some other reason that an
        empty set of search results should be returned.
