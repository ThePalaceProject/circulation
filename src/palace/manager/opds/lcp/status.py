    This document is defined as part of the Readium LCP Specifications.

    Readium calls this the License Status Document (LSD), however, that
    name conflates the concept of License. In the context of ODL and library
    lends, it's really the loan status document, so we use that name here.

    The spec for it is located here:
    https://readium.org/lcp-specs/releases/lsd/latest.html

    Technically the spec says that there must be at lease one link
    with rel="license" but this is not always the case in practice,
    especially when the license is returned or revoked. So we don't
    enforce that here.
