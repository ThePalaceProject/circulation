           - For advantage collections (with parent_identifier_set): Fetches metadata lazily,

           - If all books in the current page were added before modified_since and there were no changes detected,
             stops pagination early to avoid processing old data
           - Can be disabled with import_all=True

        3. **Change Detection**:
           - Only applies bibliographic updates if metadata has changed
           - Always checks circulation data as availability changes frequently and applies changes only if changed.

        :param apply_circulation: Callback to apply circulation data updates (copies owned, available, etc.)
