# This script makes sure that our database migrations bring the database up to date
# so that the resulting database is the same as if we had initialized a new instance.
#
# This is done by:
# (1) Finding the id of the first DB migration.
# (2) Initializing the database with an old version of the app. This old version is
#     the version of the app that was current when the first migration was created.
#     This version is started in a separate container called `webapp-old`. This
#     container is defined in the `test_migrations.yml` file.
# (3) Then the current version of the app is started in a container called `webapp`.
# (4) We run the migrations in the `webapp` container to bring the database up to date.
#     and then check that the database schema matches the model.
# (5) We then run the downgrade migrations in the `webapp` container to bring the database
#     back to the state it was in when the first migration was created.
# (6) We then check that the database schema matches the model in the `webapp-old` container.
# (7) Finally, we repeat step (4) to make sure that the up migrations stay in sync.
#
# After the migrations are complete in step (4) and (6) we use `alembic check` [1] to
# make sure that the database model matches the migrated database. If the model matches,
# then the database is in sync and the migrations are up to date. If the database doesn't
# match then there is a problem with the migrations and the script will fail.
#
# Note: This test cannot be added to the normal migration test suite since it requires
# us to have access to an older version of our code base. To facilitate this we use the
# `test_migrations.yml` file to define a container that runs an older version of the app.
# And run all the commands in this script in a docker-compose environment.
