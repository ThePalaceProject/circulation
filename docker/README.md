# Docker

## Using This Image

You will need **a PostgreSQL instance URL** in the format
`postgresql://[username]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database_name]`. Check the `./docker-compose.yml` file for an example.
With this URL, you can create containers for both the web application (`circ-webapp`) and for the background cron jobs
that import and update books and otherwise keep the app running smoothly (`circ-scripts`). Either container can be used
to initialize or migrate the database. During the first deployment against a brand new database, the first container run
can use the default `SIMPLIFIED_DB_TASK='auto'` or be run manually with `SIMPLIFIED_DB_TASK='init'`. See the
"Environment Variables" section below for more information.

### circ-webapp

Once the webapp Docker image is built, we can run it in a container with the following command.

```sh
# See the section "Environment Variables" below for more information
# about the values listed here and their alternatives.
$ docker run --name webapp -d \
    --p 80:80 \
    -e SIMPLIFIED_PRODUCTION_DATABASE='postgres://[username]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database_name]' \
    ghcr.io/thepalaceproject/circ-webapp:main
```

If the database and ElasticSearch(ES) are running in containers, use the --link option to let the webapp docker container
to access them as bellow:

```sh
docker run \
--link pg --link es \
--name circ \
-e SIMPLIFIED_PRODUCTION_DATABASE='postgres://[username]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database_name]' \
-d -p 6500:80 \
ghcr.io/thepalaceproject/circ-webapp:main
```

Navigate to `http://localhost/admin` in your browser to visit the web admin for the Circulation Manager. In the admin,
you can add or update configuration information. If you have not yet created an admin authorization protocol before,
you'll need to do that before you can set other configuration.

### circ-scripts

Once the scripts Docker image is built, we can run it in a container with the following command.

```sh
# See the section "Environment Variables" below for more information
# about the values listed here and their alternatives.
$ docker run --name scripts -d \
    -e TZ='YOUR_TIMEZONE_STRING' \
    -e SIMPLIFIED_PRODUCTION_DATABASE='postgres://[username]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database_name]' \
    ghcr.io/thepalaceproject/circ-scripts:main
```

Using `docker exec -it scripts /bin/bash` in your console, navigate to `/var/log/simplified` in the container. After
5-20 minutes, you'll begin to see log files populate that directory.

### circ-exec

This image builds containers that will run a single script and stop. It's useful in conjunction with a tool like Amazon
 ECS Scheduled Tasks, where you can run script containers on a cron-style schedule.

Unlike the `circ-scripts` image, which runs constantly and executes every possible maintenance script--whether or not
your configuration requires it--`circ-exec` offers more nuanced control of your Library Simplified Circulation Manager
jobs. The most accurate place to look for recommended jobs and their recommended frequencies is
[the existing `circ-scripts` crontab](https://github.com/NYPL-Simplified/circulation/blob/main/docker/services/simplified_crontab).

Because containers based on `circ-exec` are built, run their job, and are destroyed, it's important to configure an
external log aggregator if you wish to capture logs from the job.

```sh
# See the section "Environment Variables" below for more information
# about the values listed here and their alternatives.
$ docker run --name search_index_refresh -it \
    -e SIMPLIFIED_SCRIPT_NAME='refresh_materialized_views' \
    -e SIMPLIFIED_PRODUCTION_DATABASE='postgres://[username]:[password]@[host]:[port]/[database_name]' \
    ghcr.io/thepalaceproject/circ-exec:main
```

## Environment Variables

Environment variables can be set with the `-e VARIABLE_KEY='variable_value'` option on the `docker run` command.
`SIMPLIFIED_PRODUCTION_DATABASE` is the only required environment variable.

### `SIMPLIFIED_DB_TASK`

*Optional.* Performs a task against the database at container runtime. Options are:

- `auto` : Either initializes or migrates the database, depending on if it is new or not. This is the default value.
- `ignore` : Does nothing.
- `init` : Initializes the app against a brand new database. If you are running a circulation manager for the first
time ever, use this value to set up an Elasticsearch alias and account for the database schema for future
migrations.
- `migrate` : Migrates an existing database against a new release. Use this value when switching from one stable
version to another.

### `SIMPLIFIED_PRODUCTION_DATABASE`

*Required.* The URL of the production PostgreSQL database for the application.

### `SIMPLIFIED_TEST_DATABASE`

*Optional.* The URL of a PostgreSQL database for tests. This optional variable allows unit tests to be run in the
container.

### `TZ`

*Optional. Applies to `circ-scripts` only.* The time zone that cron should use to run scheduled scripts--usually the
time zone of the library or libraries on the circulation manager instance. This value should be selected according to
 [Debian-system time zone options](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).
 This value allows scripts to be run at ideal times.

### `UWSGI_PROCESSES`

*Optional.* The number of processes to use when running uWSGI. This value can be updated in `docker-compose.yml` or
added directly in `Dockerfile` under webapp stage. Defaults to 6.

### `UWSGI_THREADS`

*Optional.* The number of threads to use when running uWSGI. This value can be updated in `docker-compose.yml` or added
directly in `Dockerfile` under webapp stage. Defaults to 2.

## Building new images

If you plan to work with stable versions of the Circulation Manager, we strongly recommend using the latest stable
versions of circ-webapp and circ-scripts
[published to the GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/orgs/ThePalaceProject/packages?repo_name=circulation).
However, there may come a time in development when you want to build Docker containers for a particular version of the
Circulation Manager. If so, please use the instructions below.

We recommend you install at least version 18.06 of the Docker engine.

### `webapp` and `scripts` images

Determine which image you would like to build and update the tag and `Dockerfile` listed below accordingly. Run the
build command from the root of the repository not the docker folder. Use `target` option to determine which docker
image to build as bellow:

```sh
docker build --tag circ --file docker/Dockerfile --target scripts .
```

See `docker/Dockerfile` for details.

Feel free to change the image tag as you like.
