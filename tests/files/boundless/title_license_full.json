This is the philosophy of yoga as a path to a deeper awareness of self. Drawing upon her years of teaching with students, Farhi guides readers through all the pitfalls and promises of navigating a spiritual practice.  Farhi's engaging and accessible style and broad experience offer important teachings for newcomers and seasoned practitioners of yoga alike.

We all know that half of today's marriages end in divorce, but we tend to believe that our own marriages are safe. As psychiatrist John Jacobs explains in this fresh and impassioned book, marriages today are incredibly fragile, and unless a couple understands what is making contemporary marriage so vulnerable to dissolution, the marriage is at risk.Part of the problem is that people refuse to see how social and historical forces have changed the very meaning of marriage, causing serious interpersonal unhappiness. Because of increased longevity, married people live together longer than at any time in history. There's been an erosion of the social and cultural forces that traditionally kept marriages together. Confusion over gender-role responsibilities, increased expectations of sexual satisfaction, and intense time pressures on couples to work and be successful all create marital stress.And yet, most people don't acknowledge the problems in their marriage until it is too late. We tend to believe in the \"lies of marriage\" -- such concepts as soul mates, unconditional love, that children improve a relationship, that the sexual revolution has made marital sex more pleasurable, or that egalitarian marriage offers couples easy solutions -- and forget to engage in the constant hardwork required to keep our marriages alive.Dr. Jacobs believes that most marriages have significant problems at some time, but until we recognize the new realities of marriage and develop the skills required to sustain a loving, intimate relationship, marriages are at risk.Of course marriage is about love.

So the untouched beauty sheds her outer garments—and her inhibitions—to strike provocative poses before the lens of handsome photographer Eric Twyford.But each seductive attitude she assumes is stoking a fire within that Emily never knew existed—and the heat is spurring her on to ever-greater heights of sensuous abandon. Still, the devilishly desirable Eric, a consummate professional, remains unmoved by her erotic display. If Emily cannot arouse a man in the flesh, what hope does she have as a black-and-white postcard?She has already gone far beyond the boundaries of propriety. Now Emily's brazenly determined to go even farther—to seduce Eric, letting him take her to intoxicating places she has never been. But once she has reached ecstasy, will she ever be able to leave?"]},{"name":"language","values":["ENGLISH"]},{"name":"publisher","values":["HarperCollins"]},{"name":"grade level","values":["General Adult"]},{"name":"audience","values":["General Adult"]},{"name":"genre","values":["FICTION","FICTION","FICTION"]}],"formatType":"eBook","formats":["BLIO","EPUB","AXISNOW"],"releaseDate":"2009-13-10"},{"TitleID":"0008977661","active":true,"fields":[{"name":"title","values":["Manic"]},{"name":"author","values":["Cheney, Terri"]},{"name":"cover image url","values":["https:\/\/fde-contentcafecloud-dwgjf8dvedfedjc2.a01.azurefd.net\/Jacket.svc\/D65D0665-050A-487B-9908-16E6D8FF5C3E\/9780061747281\/Medium\/Logo"]},{"name":"subject","values":["BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY \/ Memoirs; BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY \/ Survival; BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY \/ Women"]},{"name":"subtitle","values":["A Memoir"]},{"name":"isbn","values":["9780061747281"]},{"name":"description","values":["An attractive, highly successful Beverly Hills entertainment lawyer, Terri Cheney had been battling debilitating bipolar disorder for the better part of her life—and concealing a pharmacy’s worth of prescription drugs meant to stabilize her moods and make her \"normal.\" In explosive bursts of prose that mirror the devastating mania and extreme despair of her illness, Cheney describes her roller-coaster existence with shocking honesty, giving brilliant voice to the previously unarticulated madness she endured.

Because even in the land of make-believe certain enemies -- and their bullets -- are very real."]},{"name":"language","values":["ENGLISH"]},{"name":"publisher","values":["HarperCollins"]},{"name":"grade level","values":["General Adult"]},{"name":"audience","values":["General Adult"]},{"name":"genre","values":["FICTION","FICTION","FICTION"]}],"formatType":"eBook","formats":["BLIO","EPUB","AXISNOW"],"releaseDate":"2009-13-10"},{"TitleID":"0008977842","active":true,"fields":[{"name":"title","values":["Mrs. Miracle"]},{"name":"author","values":["Macomber, Debbie"]},{"name":"cover image url","values":["https:\/\/fde-contentcafecloud-dwgjf8dvedfedjc2.a01.azurefd.net\/Jacket.svc\/D65D0665-050A-487B-9908-16E6D8FF5C3E\/9780061749902\/Medium\/Logo"]},{"name":"subject","values":["FICTION \/ Romance \/ Holiday; FICTION \/ Romance \/ Contemporary; FICTION \/ Small Town & Rural"]},{"name":"subtitle","values":[""]},{"name":"isbn","values":["9780061749902"]},{"name":"description","values":["Also a motion picture from the Hallmark Channel, this is a fan favorite from #1 New York Times bestselling author Debbie Macomber.  They call her Mrs. Miracle…Seth Webster's heart never healed after he lost his adored wife.

All of 31 inches tall, Cady is a true survivor in a town where -- as she says -- \"you can die of encouragement.\" Her early starring role as a lovable elf in an immensely popular American film proved a major disappointment, since moviegoers never saw the face behind the stifling rubber suit she was required to wear. Now, after a decade of hollow promises from the Industry, she is reduced to performing at birthday parties and bat mitzvahs as she waits for the miracle that will finally make her a star.  In a series of mordantly funny journal entries, Maupin tracks his spunky heroine across the saffron-hazed wasteland of Los Angeles -- from her all-too-infrequent meetings with agents and studio moguls to her regular harrowing encounters with small children, large dogs and human ignorance. Then one day a lanky piano player saunters into Cady's life, unleashing heady new emotions, and she finds herself going for broke, shooting the moon with a scheme so harebrained and daring that it just might succeed. Her accomplice in the venture is her best friend, Jeff, a gay waiter who sees Cady's struggle for visibility as a natural extension of his own war against the Hollywood Closet.  As clear-eyed as it is charming, Maybe the Moon is a modern parable about the mythology of the movies and the toll it exacts from it participants on both sides of the screen.

I'm going to be a triathlete, an Ironman.Relegated to Mr. Nak's before-school Anger Management group (which he initially believes to be populated with future serial killers and freeway snipers), Bo meets a hard-edged, down-on-their-luck pack of survivors with stainless steel shields against the world that Bo comes to see are not so different from his own. It is here he meets and falls in love with Shelly, a future American Gladiator, whose passion for physical challenge more than matches his.Ironman is a funny, sometimes heartbreaking story about growing up in the heart of struggle. It is about standing up, getting knocked down, and standing up again. It is about being heard--and learning to listen."]},{"name":"language","values":["ENGLISH"]},{"name":"publisher","values":["HarperCollins"]},{"name":"grade level","values":["Teen - Grade 7-9, Age 12-14"]},{"name":"audience","values":["Teen - Grade 7-9, Age 12-14"]},{"name":"genre","values":["YOUNG ADULT FICTION","YOUNG ADULT FICTION","YOUNG ADULT FICTION"]}],"formatType":"eBook","formats":["BLIO","EPUB","AXISNOW"],"releaseDate":"2009-22-09"},{"TitleID":"0008978185","active":true,"fields":[{"name":"title","values":["Jim & Me"]},{"name":"author","values":["Gutman, Dan"]},{"name":"cover image url","values":["https:\/\/fde-contentcafecloud-dwgjf8dvedfedjc2.a01.azurefd.net\/Jacket.svc\/D65D0665-050A-487B-9908-16E6D8FF5C3E\/9780061973260\/Medium\/Logo"]},{"name":"subject","values":["JUVENILE FICTION \/ Sports & Recreation \/ Baseball & Softball; JUVENILE FICTION \/ Native American; JUVENILE FICTION \/ Historical \/ United States \/ 20th Century"]},{"name":"subtitle","values":[""]},{"name":"isbn","values":["9780061973260"]},{"name":"description","values":["He was the world's greatest athlete, and a hero—until his medals were taken away.

Many may be familiar with the basics: no bacon, no shrimp, no cheeseburgers. But the Jewish dietary laws go deeper than that, and How to Keep Kosher explores the ins and outs. Why are some foods deemed kosher while others are not?  Why can't you mix meat and dairy dishes? How do you turn a nonkosher kitchen into a kosher one?  Do you really need multiple sets of everything -- dishes, pots, pans, and utensils? How do you keep track of what's what?Whether you are thinking about adopting a kosher lifestyle or already have a kosher home and just want tounderstand what it is all about, Lisë Stern's How to Keep Kosher is essential reading. You will learn about the biblicaland historical origins of keeping kosher, the development of the kosher certification system, specific food preparation requirements for Shabbat, Passover, and otherholidays, and how to actually set up a kosher kitchen.In straightforward language, drawing upon explanations from the Torah and Talmud, along with interviews with rabbis, academics, and laypeople who keep kosher, Lisë explores all aspects of Judaism's ancient dietary traditions as they are carried out in today's kitchen, with its range of modern appliances -- dishwashers, food processors, and microwave ovens. For the first time, one book explains both Conservative and Orthodox perspectives on kashrut, as well as opinions from other Jewish affiliations.When Lisë was nine, her parents decided to make the change -- transform their home to a kosher one -- as a core part of their evolving commitment to Judaism. Because Lisë experienced the transition as a child and keeps a kosher home today, she is uniquely qualified to explain all aspects of this traditional practice.Setting up a kosher kitchen lays the foundation for implementing the tradition; the proof is in the potato pudding.

But life in the glory lane has started to pale, and Dean has set off on a cross-country trip to figure out what's gone wrong. When he hits a lonely stretch of Colorado highway, he spies something that will shake up his gilded life in ways he can't imagine. A young woman . . . dressed in a beaver suit. Blue Bailey is on a mission to murder her ex. Or at least inflict serious damage. As for the beaver suit she's wearing . . . Is it her fault that life keeps throwing her curveballs? Witness the expensive black sports car pulling up next to her on the highway and the Greek god stepping out of it.Blue's career as a portrait painter is the perfect job for someone who refuses to stay in one place for very long. She needs a ride, and America's most famous football player has an imposing set of wheels. Now, all she has to do is keep him entertained, off guard, and fully clothed before he figures out exactly how desperate she is. But Dean isn't the brainless jock she imagines, and Blue—despite her petite stature—is just about the toughest woman Dean has ever met. They're soon heading for his summer home where their already complicated lives and inconvenient attraction to each other will become entangled with a charismatic but aging rock star; a beautiful fifty-two-year-old woman trying to make peace with her rock and roll past; an eleven-year-old who desperately needs a family; and a bitter old woman who hates them all.As the summer progresses, the wandering portrait artist and the charming football star play a high-stakes game, fighting themselves and each other for a chance to have it all.

Red-hot screwball comedies, each and every one of them. Nine of these stories were originally published by the Loveswept line between the years 1988 and 1992. All immediately went out of print and could be found only at used bookstores and yard sales.I'm excited to tell you that those nine stories are now being re-released by HarperCollins. Naughty Neighbor is the eighth in the lineup, and it's presented here in almost original form. Usually when I edit these books I do some modernizing. For instance, I change VHS to DVD, and roller skates to Rollerblades, and sticks of gum are now pieces of gum. I do this because the books were meant to be contemporary (as opposed to historical), and I don't want the reader to have a time disconnect. In the beginning of the original Naughty Neighbor, my heroine throws a handheld phone into the toilet, and the next morning she goes into the bathroom and sees the \"slim silver antenna caught between the toilet lid and seat.\" Okay, so most phones don't have extended antennas anymore, but I just loved the image . . . so I left it in. And I don't know how many women wear front-closure bras anymore, but that got left in, too.Naughty Neighbor is probably the most romancey of all the Loveswepts I wrote, but there's still a small mystery to unravel. Louisa Brannigan is a no-nonsense, hardworking press secretary, fighting her way to the top of Capitol Hill, with no help from her annoying neighbor, Pete Streeter. He receives phone calls all night long, he steals her morning paper, he thinks jeans are formal wear, and worst of all he's involved Louisa in the disappearance of a pig. So this is the story of a pig in Witness Protection and love being found by a workaholic woman and a fun-loving man who makes terrible pots of coffee.Enjoy!Janet Evanovich"]},{"name":"language","values":["ENGLISH"]},{"name":"publisher","values":["HarperCollins"]},{"name":"grade level","values":["General Adult"]},{"name":"audience","values":["General Adult"]},{"name":"genre","values":["FICTION","FICTION","FICTION"]}],"formatType":"eBook","formats":["BLIO","EPUB","AXISNOW"],"releaseDate":"2009-13-10"},{"TitleID":"0008978663","active":true,"fields":[{"name":"title","values":["Neverwhere"]},{"name":"author","values":["Gaiman, Neil"]},{"name":"cover image url","values":["https:\/\/fde-contentcafecloud-dwgjf8dvedfedjc2.a01.azurefd.net\/Jacket.svc\/D65D0665-050A-487B-9908-16E6D8FF5C3E\/9780061793059\/Medium\/Logo"]},{"name":"subject","values":["FICTION \/ Fantasy \/ Contemporary; FICTION \/ Fantasy \/ Urban; FICTION \/ Literary"]},{"name":"subtitle","values":[""]},{"name":"isbn","values":["9780061793059"]},{"name":"description","values":["The #1 New York Times bestselling author's ultimate edition of his wildly successful first novel featuring his \"preferred text\"—and including his special Neverwhere tale \"How the Marquis Got His Coat Back\"Published in 1997, Neil Gaiman's darkly hypnotic first novel, Neverwhere, heralded the arrival of a major talent and became a touchstone of urban fantasy. Over the years, a number of versions were produced both in the U.S. and the U.K. Now Gaiman's preferred edition of his classic novel reconciles these works and reinstates a number of scenes cut from the original published books.Neverwhere is the story of Richard Mayhew, a young London businessman with a good heart and an ordinary life, which is changed forever when he discovers a girl bleeding on the sidewalk. He stops to help her—an act of kindness that plunges him into a world he never dreamed existed.Slipping through the cracks of reality, Richard lands in the Neverwhere—a London of shadows and darkness, monsters and saints, murderers and angels that exists entirely in a subterranean labyrinth. The Neverwhere is home to Door, the mysterious girl Richard helped in the London Above. Door, a noblewoman whose family has been murdered, is on a quest to find the agent that slaughtered her family and thwart the destruction of this underworld kingdom. If Richard is ever to return to his former life, he must join the journey to save Door's world—and find a way to survive.A hallucinatory fantasia of mystery, mythology, and terror that \"draws equally from George Lucas, Monty Python, Doctor Who, and John Milton\" (USA Today), Neverwhere is an \"Alice in Wonderland with a punk edge\" (Poppy Z.

It is an Africa that I have come from, and an America that I have helped to create.Since they were first brought as captives to Virginia, the people who would become African Americans have struggled for freedom. Thousands fought for the rights of all Americans during the Revolutionary War, and for their own rights during the Civil War. On the battlefield, through education, and through their creative genius, they have worked toward one goal: that the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness be denied no one.Fired by the legacy of these men and women, the struggle continues today.\"Portrays the quests of individual Africans against the background of broader historical movements. Instead of a comprehensive, strict chronology, Myers offers, through freed slave Ibrahima, investigative reporter Ida Wells, artist Meta Warrick Fuller, inventor George Latimore, artist Dred Scott, the 54th Massachusetts Regiment, and others, history at its best—along with deeper understanding of past and contemporary events.

And as the investigation gets sidetracked by ugly local land disputes, it takes some troublesome twists and turns, until Sheriff Brady finds herself wading through a murky morass of graft and corruption that may have given someone reason to kill—and kill again."]},{"name":"language","values":["ENGLISH"]},{"name":"publisher","values":["HarperCollins"]},{"name":"grade level","values":["General Adult"]},{"name":"audience","values":["General Adult"]},{"name":"genre","values":["FICTION","FICTION","FICTION"]}],"formatType":"eBook","formats":["BLIO","EPUB","AXISNOW"],"releaseDate":"2009-13-10"},{"TitleID":"0008978907","active":true,"fields":[{"name":"title","values":["Paddington Here and Now"]},{"name":"author","values":["Bond, Michael ; Alley, R.

His main accomplice is Steve, a captivating fellow trainhopper who expertly accompanies him through the secretive waters of this particular way of life. Vollmann describes the thrill and terror of lying in a trainyard in the dark, avoiding the flickering flashlights of the railroad bulls; the shockingly, gorgeously wild scenery of the American West as seen from a grainer platform; the complicated considerations involved in trying to hop on and off a moving train. It's a dangerous, thrilling, evocative examination of this underground lifestyle, and it is, without a doubt, one of Vollmann's most hauntingly beautiful narratives.Questioning anything and everything, subjecting both our national romance and our skepticism about hobo life to his finely tuned, analytical eye and the reality of what he actually sees, Vollmann carries on in the tradition of Huckleberry Finn, providing a moving portrait of this strikingly modern vision of the American dream."]},{"name":"language","values":["ENGLISH"]},{"name":"publisher","values":["HarperCollins"]},{"name":"grade level","values":["General Adult"]},{"name":"audience","values":["General Adult"]},{"name":"genre","values":["TRAVEL","TRANSPORTATION","TRAVEL"]}],"formatType":"eBook","formats":["BLIO","EPUB","AXISNOW"],"releaseDate":"2009-13-10"},{"TitleID":"0008979514","active":true,"fields":[{"name":"title","values":["Never Glue Your Friends to Chairs"]},{"name":"author","values":["Applegate, Katherine ; Biggs, Brian (ILT)"]},{"name":"cover image url","values":["https:\/\/fde-contentcafecloud-dwgjf8dvedfedjc2.a01.azurefd.net\/Jacket.svc\/D65D0665-050A-487B-9908-16E6D8FF5C3E\/9780061971587\/Medium\/Logo"]},{"name":"subject","values":["JUVENILE FICTION \/ Readers \/ Chapter Books; JUVENILE FICTION \/ Humorous Stories; JUVENILE FICTION \/ School & Education"]},{"name":"subtitle","values":[""]},{"name":"isbn","values":["9780061971587"]},{"name":"description","values":["The first book in a hilarious chapter book series about an accidental rule breaker from Katherine Applegate, Newbery Medal–winning and bestselling author of The One and Only Ivan, Endling, and Wishtree.When his classmates can’t sit still for a big performance at school, Roscoe Riley takes matters into his own hands with a liberal dose of Super-Mega-Gonzo Glue—which his mom calls the don’t-you-dare glue because Roscoe isn’t supposed to use it.Roscoe doesn’t mean to break the rules—he just can’t help himself!

Is the difference found in their education, intelligence, skills, timing, work habits, contacts, luck, or their choice of jobs, businesses, or investments?The shocking answer is: None of the above!In his groundbreaking Secrets of the Millionaire Mind, T. Harv Eker states: \"Give me five minutes, and I can predict your financial future for the rest of your life!\" Eker does this by identifying your \"money and success blueprint.\" We all have a personal money blueprint ingrained in our subconscious minds, and it is this blueprint, more than anything, that will determine our financial lives. You can know everything about marketing, sales, negotiations, stocks, real estate, and the world of finance, but if your money blueprint is not set for a high level of success, you will never have a lot of money—and if somehow you do, you will most likely lose it! The good news is that now you can actually reset your money blueprint to create natural and automatic success.Secrets of the Millionaire Mind is two books in one. Part I explains how your money blueprint works. Through Eker's rare combination of street smarts, humor, and heart, you will learn how your childhood influences have shaped your financial destiny. You will also learn how to identify your own money blueprint and \"revise\" it to not only create success but, more important, to keep and continually grow it.In Part II you will be introduced to seventeen \"Wealth Files,\" which describe exactly how rich people think and act differently than most poor and middle-class people. Each Wealth File includes action steps for you to practice in the real world in order to dramatically increase your income and accumulate wealth.If you are not doing as well financially as you would like, you will have to change your money blueprint.

Perhaps the San Francisco Chronicle said it best: \"If only all history lessons could be as vibrant.\""]},{"name":"language","values":["ENGLISH"]},{"name":"publisher","values":["HarperCollins"]},{"name":"grade level","values":["General Adult"]},{"name":"audience","values":["General Adult"]},{"name":"genre","values":["FICTION","FICTION","FICTION"]}],"formatType":"eBook","formats":["BLIO","EPUB","AXISNOW"],"releaseDate":"2009-17-03"},{"TitleID":"0008980048","active":true,"fields":[{"name":"title","values":["She Comes First"]},{"name":"author","values":["Kerner, Ian"]},{"name":"cover image url","values":["https:\/\/fde-contentcafecloud-dwgjf8dvedfedjc2.a01.azurefd.net\/Jacket.svc\/D65D0665-050A-487B-9908-16E6D8FF5C3E\/9780061792649\/Medium\/Logo"]},{"name":"subject","values":["SELF-HELP \/ Sexual Instruction; HEALTH & FITNESS \/ Sexuality; EDUCATION \/ Teaching \/ Subjects \/ Health & Sexuality"]},{"name":"subtitle","values":["The Thinking Man's Guide to Pleasuring a Woman"]},{"name":"isbn","values":["9780061792649"]},{"name":"description","values":["“Every man’s must-read.

Her free-spirit mother has disappeared, and her father, once Britt’s partner in crime, has remarried and shipped her off to Red Rock, a so-called treatment facility for troubled girls. And the counselors at Red Rock? They’re completely insane. Britt’s horror at the “therapy”—vicious name-calling and grueling physical labor—is second only to her hatred for the backstabbing patients, who win privileges by ratting each other out.But when V, Bebe, Martha, and Cassie, the four girls who keep Britt from going over the edge, help her sneak out to go see Jeb, her maybe-more-than-friends bandmate, she starts to believe that there may actually be people who can help her—and people that she can help by taking down Red Rocks.

Will a visit to the tanning salon help lower your cholesterol? Why do we age? Why are some people immune to HIV? Can your genes be turned on -- or off?Joining the ranks of modern myth busters, Dr. Sharon Moalem turns our current understanding of illness on its head and challenges us to fundamentally change the way we think about our bodies, our health, and our relationship to just about every other living thing on earth, from plants and animals to insects and bacteria.Through a fresh and engaging examination of our evolutionary history, Dr. Moalem reveals how many of the conditions that are diseases today actually gave our ancestors a leg up in the survival sweepstakes. When the option is a long life with a disease or a short one without it, evolution opts for disease almost every time.Everything from the climate our ancestors lived in to the crops they planted and ate to their beverage of choice can be seen in our genetic inheritance. But Survival of the Sickest doesn't stop there. It goes on to demonstrate just how little modern medicine really understands about human health, and offers a new way of thinking that can help all of us live longer, healthier lives.Survival of the Sickest is filled with fascinating insights and cutting-edge research, presented in a way that is both accessible and utterly absorbing.

All three have been linked to silent inflammation, a condition that occurs when the body's natural immune response goes awry. Silent inflammation can continue undetected for years, continually assaulting the heart, arteries, and even the brain -- and you will not even know it.New research confirms that obesity is a primary cause of silent inflammation. And inflammation is the smoking gun that links excess body fat to today's epidemic rise in heart disease, cancer, dementia, and countless other health threats. Although the science of this relationship is complex, the bottom line is simple: If not detected and reversed, silent inflammation will devastate generations of Americans and bankrupt an increasingly stressed health care system. The medical establishment appears to be ignorant about this problem, politicians don't talk about it -- and yet virtually everyone in the country is affected by it.In his number one New York Times bestseller The Zone, Dr. Barry Sears revolutionized the way we think about nutrition when he showed that a high-carbohydrate diet is a real risk to our health. Now, with eye-opening new research in the field of hormonal control and nutrition, Dr. Sears offers the first comprehensive plan to combat silent inflammation. This important book gives us the tools and tests we need to assess the current level of silent inflammation in our bodies -- and determine our future health.As you'll discover, the Zone dietary plan -- including supplements of high-dose, ultra-refined fish oil -- is the best way to get the hormonal control you need to reduce inflammation. In The Anti-Inflammation Zone, Dr. Sears shows exactly what steps to follow to reduce your risk of each disease and condition, or to reverse it if you have it already -- in only thirty days. And the Zone Lifestyle Program includes a week of delicious Zone-friendly meals, easy home exercises, and important stress-reducing methods -- all of which work together to put you on a path toward wellness that will improve the rest of your life.The day you start fighting silent inflammation is the day that you start to slow down the aging process -- and all the chronic diseases that come with it.

What we seek, we already have. Whether we want it or not, power remains one of the central issues in all of our lives. Every day, each of us exercises power in many ways, and our every act subtly affects the world we live in. This struggle for control and authority permeates every aspect of our private and public lives, preventing us from attaining true happiness. The me-first mentality in our culture seeps unnoticed into our decisions and choices. Our bottom-line approach to getting ahead may be most visible in the business world, but the stress, fear, and anxiety it causes are being felt by people in all walks of life.With colorful anecdotes, precise language, and concrete practices, Thich Nhat Hanh illustrates how the current understanding of power leads us on a never-ending search for external markers like job title or salary. The Art of Power boldly challenges our assumptions and teaches each of us how to access the true power that is within our grasp."]},{"name":"language","values":["ENGLISH"]},{"name":"publisher","values":["HarperCollins"]},{"name":"grade level","values":["General Adult"]},{"name":"audience","values":["General Adult"]},{"name":"genre","values":["RELIGION","PHILOSOPHY","RELIGION"]}],"formatType":"eBook","formats":["BLIO","EPUB","AXISNOW"],"releaseDate":"2009-13-10"},{"TitleID":"0008984754","active":true,"fields":[{"name":"title","values":["Awakening"]},{"name":"author","values":["Armstrong, Kelley"]},{"name":"cover image url","values":["https:\/\/fde-contentcafecloud-dwgjf8dvedfedjc2.a01.azurefd.net\/Jacket.svc\/D65D0665-050A-487B-9908-16E6D8FF5C3E\/9780061857829\/Medium\/Logo"]},{"name":"subject","values":["YOUNG ADULT FICTION \/ Horror; YOUNG ADULT FICTION \/ Fantasy \/ Wizards & Witches; YOUNG ADULT FICTION \/ Fantasy \/ Contemporary"]},{"name":"subtitle","values":[""]},{"name":"isbn","values":["9780061857829"]},{"name":"description","values":["If you had met me a few weeks ago, you probably would have described me as an average teenage girl—someone normal.

But don't be fooled by its unassuming location—stumbling across the Bakery, as countless visitors have done on their way up and down the Pacific Coast, will make you feel as if you've discovered a secret: a gem of a restaurant where the food, people, and atmosphere meld together in a perfect embodiment of the spirit of Big Sur.The three restaurant owners, chef Philip Wojtowicz, baker Michelle Wojtowicz, and host Michael Gilson, escaped the Los Angeles food scene to create their version of the ideal restaurant, nestled in the heart of some of the most beautiful country in the world. This is simple, wood-fired American cooking at its best, executed in a way that lets the ingredients—seasonal and often locally produced—shine. Weekend brunches feature thick, nine-grain pancakes and savory breakfast pizza topped with crisp bacon, fresh herbs, and pasture-raised eggs. At night, Phil offers classics like Grilled Prime Rib Steak with Red Wine Sauce along with twists on traditional favorites like Venison Osso Buco or Rockfish Scampi. And every meal should end with one of Michelle's great desserts, whether it's a homemade Peppermint Ice Cream Sundae or Hazelnut Flan with Roasted Cherries.But this is more than a cookbook; it's a yearlong glimpse into what it's really like to live in Big Sur, introducing the people and places that make the restaurant's renowned food possible, including Wayne Hyland, hunter and forager, Jamie Collins, organic row cropper, and Gary Pisoni, the eccentric vintner who supplies some of the restaurant's most beloved wine.

The recipient of numerous literary prizes, including the National Book Award, the Kafka Award, and five Hugo and five Nebula Awards, this renowned writer has, in each story and novel, created a provocative, ever-evolving universe filled with diverse worlds and rich characters reminiscent of our earthly selves. Now, in The Birthday of the World, this gifted artist returns to these worlds in eight brilliant short works, including a never-before-published novella, each of which probes the essence of humanity.Here are stories that explore complex social interactions and troublesome issues of gender and sex; that define and defy notions of personal relationships and of society itself; that examine loyalty, survival, and introversion; that bring to light the vicissitudes of slavery and the meaning of transformation, religion, and history. The first six tales in this spectacular volume are set in the author's signature world of the Ekumen, \"my pseudo-coherent universe with holes in the elbows,\" as Le Guin describes it -- a world made familiar in her award-winning novel The Left Hand of Darkness. The seventh, title story was hailed by Publishers Weekly as \"remarkable . . . a standout.\" The final offering in the collection, Paradises Lost, is a mesmerizing novella of space exploration and the pursuit of happiness.In her foreword, Ursula K. Le Guin writes, \"to create difference-to establish strangeness-then to let the fiery arc of human emotion leap and close the gap: this acrobatics of the imagination fascinates and satisfies me as no other.\" In The Birthday of the World, this gifted literary acrobat exhibits a dazzling array of skills that will fascinate and satisfy us all."]},{"name":"language","values":["ENGLISH"]},{"name":"publisher","values":["HarperCollins"]},{"name":"grade level","values":["General Adult"]},{"name":"audience","values":["General Adult"]},{"name":"genre","values":["FICTION","FICTION","FICTION"]}],"formatType":"eBook","formats":["BLIO","EPUB","AXISNOW"],"releaseDate":"2009-13-10"},{"TitleID":"0008984852","active":true,"fields":[{"name":"title","values":["Bounty Hunters"]},{"name":"author","values":["Leonard, Elmore"]},{"name":"cover image url","values":["https:\/\/fde-contentcafecloud-dwgjf8dvedfedjc2.a01.azurefd.net\/Jacket.svc\/D65D0665-050A-487B-9908-16E6D8FF5C3E\/9780061836794\/Medium\/Logo"]},{"name":"subject","values":["FICTION \/ Westerns; FICTION \/ Crime; FICTION \/ Romance \/ Western"]},{"name":"subtitle","values":[""]},{"name":"isbn","values":["9780061836794"]},{"name":"description","values":["The old Apache renegade Soldado Viejo is hiding out in Mexico, and the Arizona Department Adjutant has selected two men to hunt him down.

Despite decades of assertiveness training and lots of good advice about communicating with clarity, timing, and tact, women and men find that their greatest complaints in marriage and other intimate relationships are that they are not being heard, that they cannot affect the other person, that fights go nowhere, that conflict brings only pain. Although an intimate, long-term relationship offers the greatest possibilities for knowing the other person and being known, these relationships are also fertile ground for silence and frustration when it comes to articulating a true self. And yet giving voice to this self is at the center of having both a relationship and a self. Much as she did in THE MOTHER DANCE, Lerner will approach this rich subject with tales from her personal life and clinical work, inspiring and teaching readers to speak their own truths to the most important people in their lives. "]},{"name":"language","values":["ENGLISH"]},{"name":"publisher","values":["HarperCollins"]},{"name":"grade level","values":["General Adult"]},{"name":"audience","values":["General Adult"]},{"name":"genre","values":["FAMILY & RELATIONSHIPS","PSYCHOLOGY","SELF-HELP"]}],"formatType":"eBook","formats":["BLIO","EPUB","AXISNOW"],"releaseDate":"2009-13-10"},{"TitleID":"0008984985","active":true,"fields":[{"name":"title","values":["Dangerous Lord"]},{"name":"author","values":["Jeffries, Sabrina"]},{"name":"cover image url","values":["https:\/\/fde-contentcafecloud-dwgjf8dvedfedjc2.a01.azurefd.net\/Jacket.svc\/D65D0665-050A-487B-9908-16E6D8FF5C3E\/9780061741135\/Medium\/Logo"]},{"name":"subject","values":["FICTION \/ Romance \/ Historical \/ Regency; FICTION \/ Romance \/ Historical \/ 20th Century; FICTION \/ Romance \/ Historical \/ Victorian"]},{"name":"subtitle","values":[""]},{"name":"isbn","values":["9780061741135"]},{"name":"description","values":["He was a dangerous man to love—and the last man she thought she'd marry.He was a dangerous man to love—and the last man she thought she'd marry.To prevent a dear friend from wedding the notorious Ian Lennard, Viscount St. Clair, Felicity Taylor set out to expose him for the scoundrel he is—never anticipating the consequences.

Aristocratic, elegant, and effortlessly charming, he is just arrogant enough to capture the interest of the ladies of the ton. And with his connections to the wealthy and influential Cynster family—his sister is married to Devil Cynster, the Duke of St. Ives—his future appears assured. Except that Michael lacks the single most important element of success: a wife.

He certainly has no love for Alfred, whom he considers a pious weakling and no match for Viking savagery, yet when Alfred unexpectedly defeats the Danes and the Danes themselves turn on Uhtred, he is finally forced to choose sides. By now he is a young man, in love, trained to fight and ready to take his place in the dreaded shield wall. Above all, though, he wishes to recover his father’s land, the enchanting fort of Bebbanburg by the wild northern sea.This thrilling adventure—based on existing records of Bernard Cornwell’s ancestors—depicts a time when law and order were ripped violently apart by a pagan assault on Christian England, an assault that came very close to destroying England."]},{"name":"language","values":["ENGLISH"]},{"name":"publisher","values":["HarperCollins"]},{"name":"grade level","values":["General Adult"]},{"name":"audience","values":["General Adult"]},{"name":"genre","values":["FICTION","FICTION","FICTION"]}],"formatType":"eBook","formats":["BLIO","EPUB","AXISNOW"],"releaseDate":"2009-17-03"},{"TitleID":"0008991504","active":true,"fields":[{"name":"title","values":["Last Season"]},{"name":"author","values":["Blehm, Eric"]},{"name":"cover image url","values":["https:\/\/fde-contentcafecloud-dwgjf8dvedfedjc2.a01.azurefd.net\/Jacket.svc\/D65D0665-050A-487B-9908-16E6D8FF5C3E\/9780061869990\/Medium\/Logo"]},{"name":"subject","values":["BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY \/ Adventurers & Explorers; BIOGRAPHY & AUTOBIOGRAPHY \/ Environmentalists & Naturalists; SPORTS & RECREATION \/ Outdoor Skills"]},{"name":"subtitle","values":[""]},{"name":"isbn","values":["9780061869990"]},{"name":"description","values":["Destined to become a classic of adventure literature, The Last Season examines the extraordinary life of legendary backcountry ranger Randy Morgenson and his mysterious disappearance in California's unforgiving Sierra Nevada—mountains as perilous as they are beautiful.

A shimmering meditation on the ebb and flow of love.”  —New York Times“In her elegant, sophisticated prose, Dillard tells a tale of intimacy, loss and extraordinary friendship and maturity against a background of nature in its glorious color and caprice. The Maytrees is an intelligent, exquisite novel.” — The Washington TimesToby Maytree first sees Lou Bigelow on her bicycle in postwar Provincetown, Massachusetts. Her laughter and loveliness catch his breath. Maytree is a Provincetown native, an educated poet of thirty. As he courts Lou, just out of college, her stillness draws him. Hands-off, he hides his serious wooing, and idly shows her his poems. In spare, elegant prose, Dillard traces the Maytrees' decades of loving and longing. They live cheaply among the nonconformist artists and writers that the bare tip of Cape Cod attracts. When their son Petie appears, their innocent Bohemian friend Deary helps care for him. But years later it is Deary who causes the town to talk.In this moving novel, Dillard intimately depicts willed bonds of loyalty, friendship, and abiding love. She presents nature's vastness and nearness. Warm and hopeful, The Maytrees is the surprising capstone of Dillard's original body of work."]},{"name":"language","values":["ENGLISH"]},{"name":"publisher","values":["HarperCollins"]},{"name":"grade level","values":["General Adult"]},{"name":"audience","values":["General Adult"]},{"name":"genre","values":["FICTION","FICTION","FICTION"]}],"formatType":"eBook","formats":["BLIO","EPUB","AXISNOW"],"releaseDate":"2009-13-10"}]}
