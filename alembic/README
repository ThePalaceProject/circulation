Generic single-database configuration.

For the purpose of automated deployments the `migrate_database` script is re-utilized for migrations.
Usage `migrate_database [-u <target>] [-d <target>] -h`

In order to allow autogenerated migrations please import models either into `models/__init__.py` or directly into `alembic/env.py`
