Goes through the database and checks that Contributor objects' sort_name
properties make sense in light of their display_name values.  If sort_names
need fixing, then has two options:
- Auto-performs minor fixes, such as placing a comma.

Can be called like so:
python bin/repair/check_contributor_names --identifier-type 'RBDigital ID' 9781453202715 > rbdigital_contributors_repair.csv
which generates a report file that lists the contributors affected, and whether their names
were fixed or complained about.
